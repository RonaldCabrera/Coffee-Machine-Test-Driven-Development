# Coffee Machine TDD (Test Driven Development)

This was my final project of the Software Projects Administration subject back in my ITLA days.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE for C#)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/community/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

First download or clone this repo

    You already know how to do this I assume.

Open the .sln file in your preferred C# IDE (such as Visual Studio Community) 

    Open the IDE and then open the .sln file.

And there you go, run wild!

## Running the tests

My perspective is pretty much based from Visual Studio Community as that's what I used to make this so, in this case, just alt click the NUnit Project (CoffeeMachine.UnitTests)
and then click on Run Tests.
